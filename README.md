# Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance

Local news has the potential to aid in detection of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) risks. However, articles may be in local languages or be too numerous for humans to read in full. In this project, we will use Selenium to scrape the internet for AMR-related stories around from regions of interest then apply public large language models to extract relevant information from the articles (type of threat, location, number of people affected, antibiotics administered etc.) for storage in a global AMR surveillance spreadsheet
