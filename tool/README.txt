GETTING STARTED
    .env
If you want this to work semi-seamlessly, the first thing that must be done is the creation 
of a file named ".env". This file must be placed in the same folder that the file
"main.py" is located in. The file ".env" must have the following line in it:
OPENAI_API_KEY=<'whatever your api key is without the brackets but keep the inverted commas'>
This will allow the OpenAI api to function.
    config.json
