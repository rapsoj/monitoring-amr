## Configuring files
### .env 
If you want this to work semi-seamlessly, the first thing that must be done is the creation 
of a file named ".env". This file must be placed in the same folder that all the python files are located. 
This file must have the following line in it:

OPENAI_API_KEY=<'whatever your api key is without the brackets but keep the inverted commas'>

This will allow the OpenAI api to function.
